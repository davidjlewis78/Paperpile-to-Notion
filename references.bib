@ARTICLE{Haigh1982-bf,
  title     = "The Recent Historiography of the English Reformation*",
  author    = "Haigh, Christopher",
  abstract  = "The English Reformation was not a specific event which may be
               given a precise date; it was a long and complex process. `The
               Reformation' is a colligatory concept, a historians' label which
               relates several lesser changes into an overall movement: it
               embraces a break from the Roman obedience; an assertion of
               secular control over the Church; a suppression of Catholic
               institutions such as monasteries and chantries; a prohibition of
               Catholic worship; and a protestantization of services, clergy
               and laity. Though the political decision to introduce each phase
               of change and the legislative alteration of statutes and canons
               may be dated easily enough, it is much harder to ascribe
               responsibility and motive for such measures. Moreover, as the
               interest of historians has in recent years moved on from such
               political issues towards the administrative enforcement of new
               rules and popular acceptance of new ideas, so the identification
               and explanation of change have become even more difficult: the
               pace is likely to have varied from area to area, and the
               criteria by which progress should be measured are far from
               clear. It is therefore not surprising that there has been much
               dispute over the causes and chronology of developments in
               religion, and recent interpretations of the Reformation in
               England can, with some simplification, be grouped in relation to
               two matrices. One matrix relates to the motive force behind the
               progress of Protestantism: at one extreme, it could be suggested
               that Protestant advance was entirely the result of official
               coercion, while at the other it could be said that the new
               religion spread horizontally by conversions among the people.
               The second matrix relates to the pace of religious change: on
               the one hand, it could be suggested that Protestantism made real
               progress at an early date and had become a powerful force by the
               death of Edward VI, while on the other it could be said that
               little had been achieved in the first half of the century and
               the main task of protestantizing the people had to be undertaken
               in the reign of Elizabeth. These two matrices provide us with
               four main clusters of interpretations.",

               argument for how the jeremiad illuminates the messy complexity

               community back into the image of its founders and godly
               ancestors, there is the temptation to assume that the jeremiad

               reality of change as implied in ideas of creation and
               redemption? Western Trinitarian theology in the 20thcentury
               tended toward emphasizing the significance of change above
               divine unchangeability, giving it a modalist and Hegelian
               flavour that questioned the continuity with the church fathers.
               For this reason, it has been criticized by Orthodox theologians
               like Vladimir Lossky and David Bentley Hart. Newer scholarship
               has shown the significance of Luther's appropriation of the
               doctrine of divine unknowability and his insistence on the
               difference between revelation and divine essence for his
               understanding of the Trinity, which thus may appear to be much
               closer to the position of the Orthodox critics than to the
               Lutheran theologians criticized by them. There thus seems to be
               an unused potential in Luther's doctrine of the Trinity that

               suffering in light of the work of Jamaican theologian Lewin
               Williams. It demonstrates that Williams rejects notions that
               suffering is a result of sin (just deserts) or is incapable of
               being grasped due to its meaningless nature (just desert). Human
               beings do not live in a just world, but in a tragic one. A
               tragic vision does not attempt to penetrate the opacity of evil
               by providing justifications of suffering. Rather, it recognizes
               that certain kinds of suffering are irredeemably unjust. Yet,
               unlike explanations that incorporate just deserts or just
               desert, a tragic sense burns strongly with a desire for justice,
               but burns even more fiercely with anger and pity at suffering.
               Suffering is at the core of tragedy and, according to Wendy
               Farley, ``it witnesses to the power of absurdity or malice or
               sheer force to bring down what is noble and good.'' Tragic
               vision reminds us that actions are performed in a context that
               is already tainted, disguised, lacking in moral neutrality, and
               even malevolent. In the end, the answer is not a theodicy but

               from social and political concerns due to, amongst other things,
               a dual emphasis on personal salvation and individual
               discipleship. In this paper, I suggest that far from simply
               being an inwardly ecclesial occupation, the process of ?making
               disciples? is a political activity that impacts public life,
               that is the life of communities and nations. While some
               Pentecostals may be reluctant to see discipleship in political
               terms, I will argue that the history of the movement testifies
               to the work of the Spirit as being political. I will suggest
               that in Pentecostalism we see a political movement of the Spirit
               that opposes unjust structures within the church in order to
               usher in spiritual, social and political liberation for those
               beyond the church. I will consider the unique contributions
               Pentecostalism makes to political engagement through its
               development of conscious leaders and disciples from typically
               underprivileged communities. I will end with a reflection on
               facing conflict particularly in the area of ethnic and cultural

               decline from a virtuous past and calls it to repentance and
               renewal. Employed by Americans of all political persuasions
               since the earliest days of settlement, the jeremiad has proven
               to be a powerful way of invoking the American past in order to
               chart a brighter American future. Part I of the book focuses on
               three especially important episodes in the jeremiad's history:
               early New England, Civil War America, and the rise of the
               Christian Right. Part II provides a critical analysis of the
               jeremiad's role in the American ``culture wars'' and politics
               more generally. In seeking to place the American past in the
               service of the American future, the book argues, the jeremiad
               takes not one form, but two: a traditionalist jeremiad whose
               view of the past depends heavily on claims about how things used
               to be, and emphasizes the importance of preserving concrete
               aspects of the past as we move toward an uncertain future; and a
               progressive jeremiad, which views the past as a repository of
               emancipatory principles articulated at the founding but never
               fully realized in practice. Acknowledging that both
               traditionalist and progressive jeremiads are deeply entwined
               with the nation's history, the book concludes with a call for a
               revived progressive jeremiad as most compatible with the deep
               diversity---cultural, religious, political, philosophical---that
               characterizes American society at the dawn of the twenty‐first

               Christology can be understood well if one regards them as
               stemming not from a doctrinal evolution (as some scholars
               argue), but rather from a fundamental (but usually unnoticed)
               inconsistency that is present at all times in Theodoret's life.
               The inconsistency lies between his normal pattern for writing
               about Christ and the way he sometimes writes of Christ when he
               is dealing with the crucifixion. Theodoret usually sees the
               personal subject of Christ (the one who acts and to whom the
               human experiences happen) as the Logos himself, but at times
               when he discusses the death of Christ, his strong view of divine
               impassibility leads him to see the personal subject who
               undergoes suffering and death as the man Jesus. The article

               benefited from several noteworthy studies published over the

               failed to reach a consensus on whether Irenaeus'

               argue Spirit-Christology does have a place in Irenaeus'
               theology, but that it poses no threat to his Trinitarian logic.
               I contend that two passages, previously thought to identify the
               Holy Spirit with the person of Christ, refer to the reception of
               the Holy Spirit by the believer for his or her redemption.

  abstract  = "Abstract A main theme in the study of global Pentecostalism is
               its adaptability to the modern world system; yet, the way in
               which adaptability ``works'' is not well theorized. Hannah
               Arendt's analysis of ``the private and public realm'' and Ulrich
               Beck's description of ``individualization and self-culture''
               offer heuristic frameworks for understanding how prosperity
               theology is well-suited to macro-historical patterns that
               address the growing individualization of everyday life,
               especially in relation to uncertain career paths and
               risk-oriented work structures. Arendt's and Beck's theoretical
               conceptualizations move away from sect-like notions of
               Pentecostals cultivating a bounded system among the
               non-Spirit-filled natives. Instead, their theoretical
               conceptualizations reveal Pentecostalism --- especially in its
               prosperity orientation --- to be fully compatible with
               individualization processes experienced by and demanded from
               today's workers. A case study of the ministry of Oasis Christian
               Center to Hollywood entertainment industry workers illustrates
               connections between the Prosperity/Word of Faith orientation of

  abstract  = "Abstract One of the most promising aspects of the text of the
               third phase of the International Roman-Catholic-Reformed
               Dialogue might be the suggestion to reflect upon the idea of the
               church as 'sacrament of the kingdom' (no.231). In this
               contribution, I shall take up that suggestion and develop a
               fourfold approach of the sacraments in which the
               interconnectedness of church and kingdom plays a crucial role. I
               shall deal with the soteriological, the ecclesiological, the
               eschatological and the symbolic aspect respectively.
               Deliberately, I begin with the soteriological aspect because the
               first and main thing sacraments do is to point to our salvation.
               Salvation implies, however, a mediation of salvation and hence
               the ecclesiological aspect follows the soteriological aspect.
               The mediation of the church always points beyond itself to the
               kingdom of God. That is the eschatological aspect. And every
               reference to the eschaton always has the form of the symbol as
               the focal point of the 'already' and 'not yet' character of the
               kingdom of God. We label that as the symbolic aspect. My
               conclusion will be that the fruitfulness of the suggestion to
               speak about the church as 'sacrament of the kingdom' depends on
               the preparedness to reap the results of the ecumenical
               discussions since Vatican II.",

               meaning and social worlds. The oral performance of the prophetic
               word departs from a safe homeland for a tapestry of textual
               constructions in dangerous diaspora. Along the way it traffics
               in symbolic transformations for communities under siege. More
               specifically, written prophecy attends to survivors of war and
               as such functions as a resilient counter script, a
               meaning-making map of hope, for disoriented and dislocated
               people. As a sidebar, this essay considers the implications of
               this reading for contemporary Christian communions aligned with

              Wait{\=a}kere, a Ministry of Health funded prevention initiative,
              to recruit 17 participants (including students, parents,
              teachers, community leaders, local retailers and health
              promoters) from a low-income, ethnically-diverse community in
              West Auckland, New Zealand. Three group model building workshops
              were held during which a systems map was created and used to
              identify actions by considering causal pathways and reinforcing
              loops in the system. Barriers to children's FV intake identified
              by participants were the saturation of fast-food outlets in the
              community and ubiquitous marketing of these products, the high
              cost of fresh produce compared to fast food, and parents having
              little time for food preparation plus declining cooking skills
              and knowledge. Several actions to improve children's FV intake by
              improving the local food environment were identified, which will
              be co-designed further and tested by a collaborative group
              involving community leaders. This project highlights the
              effectiveness of group model building for engaging a local

               Abraham is the father of monotheistic religions, the great
               father willing to commit filicide at God's command. God's first
               mandate was: ``Kill thy child, offer him up in sacrifice''.

               command and only at the very last moment, when he is ready to
               behead the child, God's voice reappears and says (No). Both the

               location in chapters 36--39 for ideological reasons, providing a

               Isa 39's connection with Isa 40--66, I show that Isa 39 also
               belongs to the motif of human trust prevalent in First Isaiah by
               tracking the triad ``silver, gold, and treasures'' in chapters
               2, 30--31, and 39. I further argue that chapter 39 was
               purposefully assigned its current literary location to round off
               First Isaiah's political critique of foreign alliances. As a
               necessary implication, Isa 39 does not present a pious Hezekiah.
               Instead, First Isaiah ends with a paradigmatic negative version
               of the Davidic dynasty, highlighting its failure to trust YHWH

               acting at the Council of Ephesus (431 A.D.) anathematized
               Nestorius, the Bishop of Constantinople, and pronounced
               Nestorianism a christological heresy. The decisions of the
               Council of Ephesus were accepted and re-affirmed at the Fourth
               (451 A.D.) and Fifth (553 A.D.) Ecumenical Councils. It must be
               said that ``Nestorianism'' as a special kind of doctrine could
               have been condemned as heretical could be called
               ``dyoprosopatism.'' But such was not the case. Nestorius was
               condemned and exiled as a heretic, and he was judged on the
               basis of certain doctrines which he was accused of holding. From
               the moment of his excommunication until the present time there
               have been many expressions of uncertainty as to whether he
               really taught and believed what was defined and condemned as

  abstract = "This paper argues that the christification of the least should
              shape Christology and subsequently Christian discipleship.
              Christification is articulated as the process by which
              individuals or groups, inside or outside the church and marked by
              displacement, marginalisation or persecution, are recognised as
              bearing Christ's presence in a special way. Those christified
              share in Christ's revelatory, soteriological and sanctifying role
              for the community who encounter, serve and learn from them. This
              illuminates the ethical and missional impact of christification.
              Taking Jon Sobrino's argument that Christology must take into
              account the historically received texts about Christ and the
              reality of Christ in the present, I argue that Christology cannot
              be complete without a transformative encounter with the
              christified least. For those in places of privilege,
              Christologies employing christification have an immediate effect
              on discipleship, locating the presence of Christ in the least
              amongst their community. For the marginalised, christification
              grants agency; seen as the embodiment of Christ, they facilitate
              revelation and shape ethical engagement. Attention is paid
              throughout the paper to how christification, as modelled
              particularly by theologians writing from or for marginalised or
              migrant communities, could be applied to my own Australian
              context, particularly current debates around refugees and

               people will die without having ever accepted Jesus as Lord. What
               are YOU doing about it? Is Jesus the only way to get to Heaven?
               What happens to people who have never heard the Gospel? How do I
               tell someone about Jesus? Of all the things that Jesus could
               have said before leaving earth, He chose these words, ``Go into
               all the world and preach the Gospel.'' Yet instead of obeying,
               so many Christians have chosen to ignore Christ's last words and
               make the Great Commission the Great Omission. In this book
               Joshua Wagner creatively highlights the motivations for
               evangelism while outlining some of the most common obstructions
               to evangelism. The first part of this book focuses on the
               practices of evangelism while the second half focuses on the
               theology of evangelism. After years of theological research and
               study of the Scriptures, Joshua has set out to answer some of
               life's toughest questions from a biblical perspective. This book
               is not just for missionaries or evangelists but for all
               Christians intent on obeying Christ. This book will inspire,
               challenge and empower you to make Jesus' last words your first

  author    = "Green, Joel B and Baker, Mark D",
  abstract  = "The cross is the defining symbol of the Christian faith. Yet the
               Roman cross was first and foremost an instrument of cruel,
               shameful and violent execution. Early Christians quickly
               recognized the atoning significance of the cross of Christ, and
               it resonated deeply with their experience of salvation. But the
               cross remained a blessing framed by scandal, an epochal and yet
               mysterious event irreducible to a single formulation. As Joel
               Green and Mark Baker demonstrate, the New Testament displays a
               rich array of interpretations of the cross. These were shaped by
               the church in mission as it rooted the saving story of a
               scandalous cross in the language of everyday realities and
               relationships. But for many Christians today, not only has the
               true scandal of the cross been obscured, the variety of its New
               Testament interpretations have been reduced to subpoints in a
               single, controlling view of the atonement. Tragically, the way
               in which the atonement is frequently and popularly expressed now
               poses a new scandal, one that is foreign to the New Testament
               and poses needless obstacles to twenty-first century peoples and
               cultures. At the heart of this book is a challenge for us to
               view afresh the variety of contextual understandings of the
               death of Christ in the New Testament and to reconsider how we
               can faithfully communicate with fresh models the atoning
               significance of the cross for specific contexts today. The
               authors explore how the atonement has been understood within a
               variety of contemporary contexts--both Western and
               non-Western--and show how we can enter into the thoroughly
               Christian mission of restating the saving scandal of the cross
               in our multicultural world of the twenty-first century.",

               the Zondervan Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament series
               treats the literary context and structure of the passage in the
               original Greek. The series consistently provides the main point,
               an exegetical outline, verse-by-verse commentary, and theology
               in application in each section of every commentary. Critical
               scholarship informs each step but does not dominate the
               commentary, allowing readers to concentrate on the biblical
               author's message as it unfolds. While primarily designed for
               those with a basic knowledge of biblical Greek, all who strive
               to understand and teach the New Testament will find these books
               beneficial. The ZECNT series covers the entire New Testament in
               twenty volumes; Clinton E. Arnold serves as general editor.In
               this volume, Thomas R. Schreiner offers pastors, students, and

               Schreiner presents Paul's Epistle to the Galatians with

               developed primarily after the death of Jesus when the early

               Thomas Weinandy's new conception of the Trinity, in which 'the
               Father begets the Son in or by the Holy Spirit', is developed on
               the basis of a thorough application of this axiom. The present
               article seeks to understand what the axiom entails and thus the
               security of any model of the Trinity developed through its use.
               Attention is paid to the relationship between the biblical basis
               of the doctrine of the Trinity and this doctrine itself. We
               conclude that Weinandy's use of Rahner's axiom leaves room for
               the incomprehensibility or mystery of God, but that Weinandy's
               theory runs the risk of being too confident about the nature of

               reception history helps us to find perspectives to understand
               them. This study treats the following themes among others: 1
               Hezekiah as Immanuel was an important theme in the reception as
               can be seen in Chronicles and Ben Sira as well as in rabbinical
               writings. The central event which makes Hezekiah such an
               important figure, was the annihilation of the Assyrian army as
               recounted in Isaiah 36-37.2 The Book of Isaiah was interpreted
               in apocalyptic milieu as the Animal Apocalypse and Daniel show.
               Even though the Qumran writings do not provide any coherent way
               to interpret Isaianic passages its textual evidence shows how
               the community has found from the Book of Isaiah different
               concepts to characterize the division of the Jewish community to
               the righteous and sinful ones (cf. Isa 65-66).3 Ezra and
               Nehemiah received inspiration from the theological themes of
               Isaianic texts of Levitical singers which were later edited in
               the Book of Isaiah by scribes. The formation of the Book of
               Isaiah then went in its own way and its theology became
               different from that in the Book of Ezra-Nehemiah.",

               Transformation of Child Sacrifice in Judaism and Christianity",
  author    = "Levenson, Jon D",
  abstract  = "The near-sacrifice and miraculous restoration of a beloved son
               is a central but largely overlooked theme in both Judaism and
               Christianity, celebrated in biblical texts on Isaac, Ishmael,
               Jacob, Joseph, and Jesus. In this highly original book, Jon D.
               Levenson explores how this notion of child sacrifice constitutes
               an overlooked bond between the two religions. Levenson argues
               that although the practice of child sacrifice was eradicated
               during the late seventh and sixth centuries B.C.E, the idea of
               sacrificing the first-born son (or the late-born son whose
               preferential treatment promotes him to that exalted rank)
               remained potent in religious literature. Analyzing texts from
               the ancient Near East, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and
               rabbinic literature, Levenson shows how tales of the son handed
               over to death by his loving father in the Hebrew Bible
               influenced the Church's identification of Jesus as sacrificial
               victim. According to Levenson, the transformation of the idea of
               child sacrifice was central to the accounts given by the people
               Israel and the early Church of their respective origins, and it
               also underlay the theologies of chosenness embraced, in their
               differing ways, by the two religions. Furthermore, the
               longstanding claim of the Church that it supersedes the Jews,
               says Levenson, both continues and transforms elements of the old
               narrative pattern in which a late-born son dislodges his
               first-born brothers. Levenson's book, which offers novel
               interpretations of several areas crucial to biblical studies,
               will be essential reading for scholars in the field.",

  abstract  = "National polls show that approximately 50 million adult
               Americans are born-again Christians. Yet most Americans see
               their culture as secular, and the United States is viewed around
               the world as a secular nation. Further, intellectuals and
               journalists often portray born-again Christians, despite their
               numbers, as outsiders who endanger public life. But is American
               culture really so neatly split between the religious and the
               secular? Is America as ``modern'' and is born-again Christian
               religious belief as ``pre-modern'' as many think? In the 1980s,
               born-again Christians burst into the political arena with
               stunning force. Gone was the image of ``old-fashioned''
               fundamentalism and its anti-worldly, separatist philosophy.
               Under the leadership of the Reverend Jerry Falwell and allied
               preachers, millions broke taboos in place since the Scopes trial
               constraining their interaction with the public world. They
               claimed new cultural territory and refashioned themselves in the
               public arena. Here was a dynamic body of activists with an
               evangelical vision of social justice, organized under the rubric
               of the ``Moral Majority.'' Susan Harding, a cultural
               anthropologist, set out in the 1980s to understand the
               significance of this new cultural movement. The result, this
               long-awaited book, presents the most original and thorough
               examination of Christian fundamentalism to date. Falwell and his
               co-pastors were the pivotal figures in the movement. It is on
               them that Harding focuses, and, in particular, their use of the
               Bible's language. She argues that this language is the medium
               through which born-again Christians, individual and collective,
               come to understand themselves as Christians. And it is inside
               this language that much of the born-again movement took place.
               Preachers like Falwell command a Bible-based poetics of great
               complexity, variety, creativity, and force, and, with it,
               attempt to mold their churches into living testaments of the
               Bible. Harding focuses on the words--sermons, speeches, books,
               audiotapes, and television broadcasts--of individual preachers,
               particularly Falwell, as they rewrote their Bible-based
               tradition to include, rather than exclude, intense worldly
               engagement. As a result of these efforts, born-again Christians
               recast themselves as a people not separated from but engaged in
               making history. The Book of Jerry Falwell is a fascinating work
               of cultural analysis, a rare account that takes fundamentalist
               Christianity on its own terms and deepens our understanding of
               both religion and the modern world.",

  abstract  = "Every leader desires to be a healthy one, while every follower
               wants his leader to be healthy. The presence of healthy leaders
               brings blessing and peace to the community, while their absence
               results in much pain for the people and dysfunctionality for the
               organization. But, what does \?\`healthy\?\` mean? Humble,
               gentle, protective, upright, honest, decisive, able to teach,
               responsible, visionary, self-giving... the list can go on and
               on. However, the longer the list, the less likely we\?\`ll be
               motivated to try to become such a leader \?\` how can one ever
               achieve such an ocean of virtues? This book presents an
               alternative! Every characteristic of a healthy leader falls into
               five categories: Christ, Community, Character, Calling and
               Competencies. This ConneXions model offers us a biblical and
               distilled conceptual framework to understand the nature of a
               \?\`healthy\?\` leader: An effective, healthy Christian leader
               is a man or woman who knows God, was formed and lives in
               supportive and accountable community, has strong character,
               knows the purpose of God and presents it with credibility,
               clarity and passion, and has the necessary gifts, skills and
               knowledge to lead the people in the accomplishment of this
               purpose \?\` and is continually growing in all five areas. This
               book describes a clear and reachable goal of life transformation
               for everyone who desires to grow; moreover, its inspiring
               teaching will nurture and ignite your inner motivation to pursue
               this transformation. You can become a great leader, a healthy
               leader!",

  abstract  = "The night before his crucifixion, in the garden of Gethsemane,
               Jesus asks his Father to take away the cup of his suffering, but
               then says, ``not my will, but yours, be done.'' Shortly
               afterward, Judas arrives, and his arrival reveals something
               important about the Father's will. Yet much remains obscure. The
               sheer fact of Christ's crucifixion shows only that God was not
               willing to spare his Son. It does not shed any light on the
               positive content of the Father's will. Drawing on philosophical
               analysis and historical-critical exegesis, The Father's Will
               sets out to clarify the Father's will for Christ and how it
               relates to his death on the cross. Then, after considering the
               theologies of Anselm and Peter Abelard, it argues for the
               recovery of the early Christian category of ransom. Since
               Christians look to the crucifixion to make sense of their
               suffering, the Father's will for Christ relates to many
               existential questions; it also shapes the place of God the
               Father in Christian theology and culture. Interpreting the
               crucifixion as a ransom makes the goodness of God more evident.
               It also makes it easier to see God the Father as the author of
               our salvation, rather than a stern judge who must be placated.
               And since the category of ransom traces back to Jesus' saying in
               the Gospels about giving his life {\"a}s a ransom for many,¨it
               has great claim to interpret the crucifixion in the way Jesus

               in Germany. Late Monasticism and the Reformation contains an
               edition of a poignant chronicle from the eve of the Reformation
               and a new collection of essays. The first part of the book is a

               previously available in a small privately financed edition which
               has long been out of print. The last English monastic chronicle,

               the Dissolution. Besides giving an intimate portrait of the
               community at Butley, it reveals many details concerning the
               local history and personalities of Suffolk during that period.
               The second part contains the most important essays published by

               concern such areas of current interest as the strength and

               the place of anticlericalism in the English Reformation; and

               in self concepts has led to an overly dichotomized view of
               Eastern sociocentric selves ``versus'' Western individualistic
               selves. While most anthropologists agree on the need for a
               richer theoretical understanding of the self beyond the bipolar
               ego/sociocentric model, few theorists have suggested ways in
               which this model could be improved upon, especially on the
               Western side of the dichotomy. Although many anthropologists are
               beginning to break down the homogenous constructs of the
               sociocentric self in Eastern societies they study, this has not
               yet been rigorously attempted in the West. In this article, I
               focus on some of the problems with the dichotomy, with
               particular emphasis on problems on the Western ``side''--namely,
               the assumption that individualism precludes sociocentrism, the
               tendency to equate the West with America, the misrepresentation
               of the Western philosophical tradition, the homogenization of
               Western individualism, and the re-creation of the
               ego/sociocentric dichotomy within the West along gender and
               class lines. Finally, questions posed by social psychologists
               engaged in the individualism/collectivism debate, as well as
               examples from my own research on child rearing in Manhattan and

               understanding of discipleship from the entire New Testament
               corpus? Many scholars recognize that the theme of discipleship
               is found throughout the New Testament, even in Revelation, with
               all of its symbolism and bizarre imagery. But how does it do
               this? The focus of this study, through the use of content

               discipleship is not only found in the Apocalypse, but is also

               read the book of Revelation once again. As they read it this
               time through the eyes of the oppressed, the content of the book
               will prove extremely valuable to aid disciples of Jesus in their
               efforts to ``follow the Lamb wherever he goes'' (Rev 14:4), no

               approach to his interpretation of this material, making good use

               prophetic ministry of at least thirty-eight years, and perhaps
               as long as fifty-three years, Roberts also suggests Isaiah often
               reedited older oracles from early in his ministry to address
               new, though somewhat analogous situations, albeit with different
               players, later in his ministry, without erasing telltale signs

  abstract = "This dissertation concerns the intersection between the New
              Testament use of the Old Testament, hermeneutics, and ethics in
              Paul's use of Isaiah's servant prophecy. After setting out the
              need for this study, the first stage of the research examines the
              verses in their original Masoretic context and demonstrates that
              Isaiah's servant prophecies are tightly integrated into their
              context to form one broad prophetic arc. This arc promises that a
              servant will save people from sin through his victorious death
              and ensuing work through his followers and thus bring them into
              God's new creation; it is therefore truly a salvation history.
              The second stage of the research considers the extant Second
              Temple interpretations of these verses, especially by Isaiah's
              Septuagint translator. In each case the author's conception of
              history is shown to warrant both the choice and use of the
              particular verses. The third stage considers Paul's use of
              Isaiah's Servant prophecy in Romans, 2 Corinthians, and
              Galatians. With respect to hermeneutical warrant, Paul uses the
              texts of Isaiah in line with its salvation history, which he
              argues has reached its fulfilment in the death of Christ and the
              ensuing proclamation of the gospel. More than this, Paul's own
              union with Christ also warrants his application of several of
              these texts to his own life and ministry---especially from Isa
              49---as Jesus Christ the servant continues to discharge his work
              of the proclamation of the gospel to the nations through his
              servant Paul. With respect to his ethics, Paul uses Isaiah's
              prophecy of the servant to define the place of and the
              relationships between God, Jesus, himself, his Christian hearers,
              gentiles who have not heard the message of the gospel, Jews, and
              all those who refuse to obey the gospel by trusting its message
              and messenger. Paul draws both general and specific ethical
              entailments on the basis of these relationships. This suggests,
              therefore, that Paul does work with an indicative-imperative
              ethic, although the indicative side of the construal must be
              salvation-historically shaped to do justice to the way in which
              Paul conceives of ethics for both himself and his hearers.",

               John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Movement, once said,
               ``The way to keep a Methodist alive is to keep him moving.'' It
               is time to recapture this simple yet profound truth and get back
               to the basics of making fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ.
               The authors developed and launched a highly successful pathway
               to discipleship in their church (Morning Star UMC, in St.Louis).
               Here, they show others how to create a successful discipleship
               pathway for their own particular contexts, based on the
               principles developed at Morning Star. Willard and Schreiner
               share the process of developing a discipleship pathway that
               meets individual people where they are. They provide examples of
               each element and practical instruction on how to plan, implement
               and sustain the discipleship pathway. The authors are teaching

               Christianity stands as the very antithesis of the message of
               Jesus Christ. In his new book, Christians Against Christianity,
               best-selling author and religious scholar Obery M. Hendricks Jr.
               challenges right-wing evangelicals on the terrain of their own
               religious claims, exposing the falsehoods, contradictions, and
               misuses of the Bible that are embedded in their rabid
               homophobia, their poorly veiled racism and demonizing of
               immigrants and Muslims, and their ungodly alliance with big
               business against the interests of American workers.He scathingly
               indicts the religious leaders who helped facilitate the rise of
               the notoriously unchristian Donald Trump, likening them to the
               ``court jesters'' and hypocritical priestly sycophants of bygone
               eras who unquestioningly supported their sovereigns' every act,
               no matter how hateful or destructive to those they were supposed
               to serve.In the wake of the deadly insurrectionist attack on the
               US Capitol, Christians Against Christianity is a clarion call to
               stand up to the hypocrisy of the evangelical Right, as well as a
               guide for Christians to return their faith to the life-affirming
               message that Jesus brought and died for. What Hendricks offers
               is a provocative diagnosis, an urgent warning that right-wing
               evangelicals' aspirations for Christian nationalist supremacy
               are a looming threat, not only to Christian decency but to

  abstract  = "Twenty years ago, historians thought they understood the
               Reformation in England. Professor A. G. Dickens's elegant The
               English Reformation was then new, and highly influential: it
               seemed to show how national policy and developing reformist
               allegiance interacted to produce an acceptable and successful
               Protestant Reformation. But, since then, the evidence of the
               statute book, of Protestant propagandists and of heresy trials
               has come to seem less convincing, Neglected documents,
               especially the records of diocesan administration and parish
               life, have been explored, new questions have been asked - and
               many of the answers have been surprising. Some of the old
               certainties have been demolished, and many of the assumptions of
               the old interpretation of the Reformation have been undermined,
               in a wide-ranging process of revision. But the fruits of the new
               'revisionism' are still buried in technical academic journals,
               difficult for students and teachers to find and to use. There is
               no up-to-date textbook, no comprehensive new survey, to
               challenge the orthodoxies enshrined in older works. This volume
               seeks to fulfill two crucial needs for students of Tudor
               England. First, it brings together some of the most readable of
               the recent innovative essays and articles into a single book.
               Second, it seeks to show how a new 'revisionist' interpretation
               of the English Reformation can be constructed, and examines its
               strengths and weaknesses. In short, it is an alternative to a
               new textbook survey - until someone has time (and courage) to
               write one. The new Introduction sets out the framework for a new
               understanding of the Reformation, and shows how already
               published work can be fitted into it. The nine essays (one
               printed here for the first time) provide detailed studies of
               particular problems in Reformation history, and general surveys
               of the progress of religious change. The new Conclusion tries to
               plug some of the remaining gaps, and suggests how the
               Reformation came to divide the English nation. It is a
               deliberately controversial collection, to be used alongside
               existing textbooks and to promote rethinking and debate.",

               outstanding history of a crucial and turbulent period in British
               and European history. Revised several times since its first

               the story of Adam and Eve has resonated richly through the

               taking it at face value is incongruous. And even for many
               thinking Christians today who want to take seriously the
               authority of Scripture, insisting on a ``literal'' understanding
               of Genesis 2--3 looks painfully like a ``tear here'' strip
               between faith and science. How can Christians of good faith move
               forward? Who were the historical Adam and Eve? What if we've
               been reading Genesis---and its claims regarding material
               origins---wrong? In what cultural context was this couple, this
               garden, this tree, this serpent portrayed? Following his
               groundbreaking Lost World of Genesis One, John Walton explores
               the ancient Near Eastern context of Genesis 2--3, creating space
               for a faithful reading of Scripture along with full engagement
               with science for a new way forward in the human origins debate.
               As a bonus, an illuminating excursus by N. T. Wright places Adam
               in the implied narrative of Paul's theology. The Lost World of

  abstract = "The prophetic books represent nearly one-third of the Old
              Testament, yet many pastors avoid preaching from the prophets
              because of the difficulty of understanding these passages or
              because of a perceived lack of relevance in these texts. As a
              result, many worshippers rarely hear a message from the prophets
              today. However, Paul includes the prophetic books in his
              statement that all Scripture is inspired by God and useful for
              training in righteousness (2 Tim. 3:16). Therefore, preachers
              have an obligation to preach from all areas of Scripture, not
              just sections with which they are comfortable. The purpose of
              this research project was to measure cognitive and affective
              changes in the worship participants of Ross Christian Church
              during a seven-week sermon series from the book of Isaiah. This
              study utilized an explanatory, mixed-methods design to measure
              quantitative and qualitative changes in the participants'
              knowledge of and affective responses to seven major themes of
              Isaiah's message. The findings reflect a strong interest among
              participants in understanding Isaiah's message and in learning
              how to apply that message to their lives. Additionally,
              participants' knowledge of and affective responses to Isaiah's
              themes increased slightly as a result of hearing this sermon
              series. These findings suggest that pastors who learn how to
              demonstrate the relevance of the prophets' message will improve
              their preaching and strengthen their congregations.",

               its very nature missionary'' has often been taken out of context
               and used to support all manner of church initiatives. But, the
               conclusion of the statement---''since . . . it has its origin in
               the mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit``---is of monumental
               importance. In The Way of Discipleship, theologian Anthony
               Gittins describes the eternal mission of the Trinity,
               historically brought ''down to earth`` in the ministry of Jesus,
               and then continued to the ends of the earth by those called and
               sent as disciples throughout future generations. Gittins
               explains that Christian discipleship must be the living out of
               Jesus' own example in many different times and places. He
               encourages people of all ages to follow the invitation of Jesus
               to be missionary disciples. The Way of Discipleship explores
               several New Testament examples of Jesus' call and commissioning,
               distills the principles involved, and then recontextualizes the
               stories so that they pose a direct challenge to disciples today.
               In this way, Gittins builds up a picture both of ''the Way`` of
               Jesus himself, and of the way in which today's disciples can
               loyally follow his call to mission.",

              Abraham's portrait suggests Christ as the Beloved Son, but the
              vicarious death of Jesus on the Cross is unrelated to Isaac in
              Genesis 22. Isaac is the type of Christ only in the preparation
              of death. Jesus as the Tamid lamb (not as the Paschal lamb)
              refers to Genesis 22 without granting expiation of sin by Isaac.
              The resurrection motif as well as the promise-fulfilment scheme

               on the church and the development of Western thought through the
               past two millennia. Major articles examine in detail all of

  author    = "Grey, Jacqueline",
  abstract  = "Three's a Crowd brings together the three dialogue partners of
               Pentecostalism, hermeneutics, and the Old Testament. Previous
               attempts by Pentecostal academics to define a distinctive
               Pentecostal hermeneutic have focused on issues and application
               to the New Testament, consequently estranging the Old Testament
               from the conversation. This book engages the hermeneutical
               practices of Pentecostal and Charismatic groups in reading the
               Old Testament in ways that are representative, while critical,
               of their movement's ideological bases and visions. While the
               issue of understanding and developing a viable Pentecostal
               hermeneutic has continued to be debated within the academic
               journals of the community for over a decade, most discussion has
               focused on the prescription of ideals rather than on the actual
               practice of the contemporary community. By examining the reading
               practices of the Pentecostal and Charismatic community, this
               book suggests a unique and rounded reading method that maintains
               the strengths of Pentecostal reading practices while addressing
               their inherent weaknesses. In this way, the voices of the three
               dialogue partners emerge in a mutual fellowship that engages
               both the needs of the Pentecostal community and informs the
               wider ecumenical dialogue.",

  author    = "Fee, Gordon D",
  abstract  = "``Fee's book is the most comprehensive treatment available of
               Paul's understanding of the Holy Spirit, a topic that has rarely
               received sufficient attention in studies of Pauline theology.
               Fee's method is exemplary: he first analyzes Paul's statements
               about the Spirit, in each individual letter, and then moves to a
               synthesis of Paul's general pneumatology. The result is a book
               that is deeply exegetical, doing justice both to the
               particularity of Paul's writings and to the fundamental unity of
               his vision for the Spirit's role in the life of the Christian
               community. Most importantly, Fee emphasizes insistently that the
               Holy Spirit must be experienced as a living presence within the
               church. That message is both faithful to Paul and urgent for the
               community of faith in our time.''--Richard B. Hays, professor of
               New Testament, Duke University Divinity School``With the energy
               and care that is a trademark of his work, Gordon Fee here fills
               a significant gap in Pauline studies. Both those who find talk
               about the Holy Spirit congenial and those who would happily
               marginalize it will be instructed by this book. Fee makes a
               genuine contribution as he examines Paul's letters in
               conversation with both the exegetical tradition of the academy
               and the pressing needs of the church.''--Beverly R. Gaventa,
               professor of New Testament and exegesis, Princeton Theological
               Seminary``Fee uniquely combines professional competence as a
               text critic, an exegete, an author and editor of major
               commentaries, and a foremost evangelical interpreter of Paul
               with a lifetime of formation and ministry among the
               Pentecostals--this century's providential witnesses to the work
               of the Spirit of God among us. . . . Fee's work offers an
               enduring encyclopedia of Pauline pneumatological exegesis, easy
               to consult for next Sunday's sermon, yet substantial enough to
               take its place near George Ladd's Theology of the New Testament
               as a must-have, within arm's reach, for serious interpreters of
               Paul's gospel. . . . Fee's work is the theological crown of a
               distinguished exegetical career.''--Russell P. Spittler, senior

               history, its organisation and spirituality, but how it has
               changed politics, sex, and human society. Diarmaid MacCulloch
               ranges from Palestine in the first century to India in the
               third, from Damascus to China in the seventh century and from
               San Francisco to Korea in the twentieth. He is one of the most

               the development of Christian history differently from any of his
               predecessors. He shows how, after a semblance of unity in its
               earliest centuries, the Christian church divided during the next
               1400 years into three increasingly distanced parts, of which the
               western Church was by no means always the most important: he

               by something. Tradition, finances, programs, personalities,
               events, seekers, and even buildings can each be the controlling
               force in a church. But Rick Warren believes that in order for a
               church to be healthy it must become a purpose-driven church,
               built around the five New Testament purposes given to the church
               by Jesus. ``The issue is church health, not church growth!''

               naturally. Healthy, consistent growth is the result of balancing
               the five biblical purposes of the church.'' Rick Warren shares a
               proven five-part strategy that will enable your church to grow -
               warmer through fellowship - deeper through discipleship -
               stronger through worship - broader through ministry - larger
               through evangelism The Purpose Driven(R) Church shifts the focus
               away from church building programs to emphasizing a
               people-building process. Warren says, ``If you will concentrate
               on building people, God will build the church.''",

               Elton (1921-1994) was one of the great historians of the Tudor
               period. England Under the Tudors is his major work and an
               outstanding history of a crucial and turbulent period in British
               and European history. Revised several times since its first
               publication in 1955, England Under the Tudors charts a
               historical period that witnessed monumental changes in religion,
               monarchy, and government - and one that continued to shape
               British history long after. Spanning the commencement of Henry
               VII's reign to the death of Elizabeth I, Elton's magisterial
               account is populated by many colourful and influential
               characters, from Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas Cranmer, and Thomas
               Cromwell to Henry VIII and Mary Queen of Scots. Elton also

               industry, seapower, and the role of the arts and literature.

              function of Isaiah's eschatological vision of a transformed world
              by the [Hebrew characters omitted] from on high in Isa 32:9--20
              within the final form of the book. Unlike past [Hebrew characters
              omitted] studies that examined the role of the [Hebrew characters
              omitted] in Isa 32:15 in isolation from its present literary
              context in favor of their own dating or reconstruction of the
              text, this study employs a canonical-linguistic approach combined
              with a web-like approach, and argues that the canonical placement
              of Isa 32:9--20 in its present literary position is
              hermeneutically and theologically significant within its co-texts
              (28--33), at a sectional level (1--39 and 40--66), and at the
              book level (1--66). Within its co-texts, Isa 32:9--20 functions
              to promote the theme that Yahweh is trustworthy to provide peace
              and well-being for those who put their trust in him amidst the
              imperial threat of the Assyrians. At the book level, Isa 32:9--20
              functions as a mirror text, harking back to Yahweh's plan to
              establish his kingdom of righteousness through his [Hebrew
              characters omitted], which will empower a Davidic agent (11:1--5;
              cf. 8:23--9:6; 16:1--5; 28:5--6; 32:1--8), and looking forward to
              an era when Yahweh's [Hebrew characters omitted] will no longer
              be confined to a Davidic agent but will be available to the
              entire people of God (32:15). This anticipation paves the way for
              the Spirit-filled servant(s) (individual and/or collective) who
              function as Yahweh's faithful agents in Isa 40-66 (42:1--9,
              44:1--5; 61:1--11; cf. 48:16b; 59:21), whose identities are
              defined not in terms of ethnicity but in terms of obedience and
              submission to Yahweh's kingship. Thus, the prophet's
              eschatological vision in Isa 32:9--20 functions to advocate the
              theme that Yahweh, the supreme King over the nations and
              creation, is sovereign in working out his salvific plan through
              the global mission of his [Hebrew characters omitted], which
              empowers not only a Davidic agent (Isa 1--39) but also the entire
              people of God to participate in the establishment of Yahweh's
              kingdom of righteousness in Zion that extends to the whole world,
              encompassing the servant(s) in Isa 40--66 and readers in all ages

               Irenaeus, and the Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching in
               particular, is pivotal in showing the way in which the fathers
               of the church interpreted scripture and distilled doctrine. The
               Demonstration is an important hinge showing how the doctrine of
               the fourth century with its definitive councils and definitions
               of faith, opens out from the new testament apostolic and
               evangelical witness. Presenting the full translation of the
               Demonstration of Irenaeus by Dean Armitage Robinson, this book
               offers a detailed theological commentary by Canon Iain MacKenzie
               on this foundational doctrinal text. MacKenzie sets out the main
               theological themes throughout Irenaeus' work, and explores his
               method of systematic theology, Athanasius's dependence on
               Irenaeus, and Irenaeus' influence on doctrine in the fourth
               century - particularly the works of Athanasius, Basil of
               Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa.
               Highlighting the importance of this second century theologian
               for theology today, this commentary and theological
               interpretation offers an incentive to study Irenaeus in the
               wider development of Christian doctrine as a cardinal figure in
               the appreciation of systematic theology.",

               argue that the Akedah presents not only an ethical question but
               also an ethical reply. But for the intervention of the angel,
               Abraham would have killed his son. Obedience to God take
               precedence over morality as humanly conceived. Yet, the angel of
               YHWH that appears to Abraham is a later addition to the text;
               thus, in the original narrative Abraham actually disobeys the
               divine command to slay his son, and sacrifices a ram instead.The
               first part of the book shows how the ``original'' version of the
               narrative did not contain the angelic figure. The second part of
               the book re-examines various religious interpretations of the
               text to show that exegetes such as Maimonides and his followers
               did point out Abraham's disobedience. According to these writers
               the esoteric layer of the story in fact declares that
               disobedience to God's command was Abraham's true affirmation of
               faith. In the third part of the book, Boehm re-opens the
               philosophical debate between Kant and Kierkegaard. Boehm
               concludes the book by contending that the monotheistic model of
               faith presented by Abraham was actually a model of disobedience.",

  abstract  = "Historical-critical scholars have often thought that writing a
               coherent theology of Isaiah 56-66 is impossible because it
               contains such historically and ideologically diverse materials.
               A canonical approach to the chapters is, however, open to
               considering Third Isaiah as a complex but coherent theological
               unity. Leaning on this approach, Abraham Oh constructs a
               theology of Isaiah 56-66. Arguing that the theology of Third
               Isaiah has eschatology (both prophetic and apocalyptic) at its
               core, he identifies four major themes and explores their
               significance through four key texts (56:1-8; 59:15b-21; 60:1-22;
               65:13-25). The covenant concept (56:1-8) forms a framework for
               the eschatology in these chapters. People are invited to walk in
               the covenant, which is worked out as eschatological salvation.
               The coming of YHWH as the Divine Warrior initiates the
               eschatological era (59:15b-21) and, bringing judgment, restores
               the covenant. As the Temple-city-paradise (60:1-22) into which
               the nations flow, the glorified Zion is the eschatological
               fulfilment of the covenant, Zion, and Servant traditions. The
               New Heavens and Earth (65:13-25) is a return to the primordial
               paradise, where the natural world is restored, as the problem of
               sin is resolved.",

               influence of evangelical Christians in recent American politics
               with a focus on racial justice. Peter Goodwin Heltzel considers
               four evangelical social movements: Focus on the Family, the
               National Association of Evangelicals, Christian Community
               Development Association, and Sojourners. The political motives
               and actions of evangelical groups are founded upon their
               conceptions of Jesus Christ, Heltzel contends. He traces the
               roots of contemporary evangelical politics to the prophetic
               black Christianity tradition of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the
               socially engaged evangelical tradition of Carl F. H. Henry.
               Heltzel shows that the basic tenets of King's and Henry's
               theologies have led their evangelical heirs toward a prophetic
               evangelicalism in a shade of blue green--blue symbolizing the
               tragedy of black suffering in the Americas, and green
               symbolizing the hope of a prophetic evangelical engagement with
               poverty, AIDS, and the environment. This fresh theological
               understanding of evangelical political groups shines new light
               on the ways evangelicals shape and are shaped by broader

               He begins with exegesis of the Hebrew text, highlighting the
               recurrence of key words, phrases, and themes throughout the
               book. He also draws attention to passages particularly pertinent
               to earlier readers either facing or returning from exile,
               offering a historical context outside a solely Christian
               perspective. The second half of the book unpacks the numerous
               theological horizons of Genesis -- main unifying themes
               (descendants, blessing, land); key theological teachings of
               Genesis (creation, fall, character and image of God, life of
               faith); and the contribution of Genesis to theology today,
               including its impact on science, ecology, and feminist theology.
               McKeown's Genesis provides a solid examination of a scriptural
               book that reflects the struggles and hopes of its readers --
               ancient and modern -- and offers encouragement for their walk

               the world's largest religion. He depicts the life of Christ and

               and then expanded from there to the rest of the world. While

               us to God's transforming love and the changes that only God can
               bring about in our lives. Picking up on the monastic tradition
               of creating a ``rule of life'' that allows for regular space for
               the practice of the spiritual disciplines, this book takes you
               more deeply into understanding seven key disciplines along with
               practical ideas for weaving them into everyday life. Each
               chapter includes exercises to help you begin the
               practices--individually and in a group context. The final
               chapter puts it all together in a way that will help you arrange
               your life for spiritual transformation. The choice to establish
               your own sacred rhythm is the most important choice you can make
               with your life.",

               irrelevance, the doctrine of the church has suffered the studied
               neglect of many Christian leaders. The persistent demands to
               market, manage and grow the church and to meet the felt needs of
               churched and unchurched all threaten to quench theological
               reflection on the abiding nature and mission of the church. But
               few activities bear greater promise as a starting point for
               renewing and reshaping the Christian church than the work of
               theology. In this book Edmund Clowney takes up that task,
               addressing along the way a variety of contemporary concerns:
               worship, mission, church and culture, church and state, church
               order and discipline, the ministry of women, baptism and the
               Lord's Supper, tongues and prophecy, signs and wonders. He draws
               on decades of thinking and teaching about the church as well as
               from his committed leadership and ministry within the church.

              ontological principles; thus confusing the object of
              philosophical reflection (absolute being) with the object of
              theological reflection (the triune God acting ad extra). The

               long been the go-to source for studying the lives and martyrdom
               of the apostles. Whilst other scholars have written individual
               treatments on the more prominent apostles such as Peter, Paul,
               John, and James, there is little published information on the
               other apostles. In The Fate of the Apostles, Sean McDowell
               offers a comprehensive, reasoned, historical analysis of the
               fate of the twelve disciples of Jesus along with the apostles
               Paul, and James. McDowell assesses the evidence for each
               apostle's martyrdom as well as determining its significance to
               the reliability of their testimony. The question of the fate of
               the apostles also gets to the heart of the reliability of the
               kerygma: did the apostles really believe Jesus appeared to them
               after his death, or did they fabricate the entire story? How
               reliable are the resurrection accounts? The willingness of the
               apostles to die for their faith is a popular argument in
               resurrection studies and McDowell offers insightful scholarly
               analysis of this argument to break new ground within the spheres
               of New Testament studies, Church History, and apologetics.",

  abstract  = "Recipient of a Christianity Today 1994 Critics Choice Award
               Among Old Testament prophetic books no other equals Isaiah's
               brilliance of style and metaphor, its arresting vision of the
               Holy One of Israel and its kaleidoscopic vision of God's future
               restoration of Israel and the world. Now, after over three
               decades of studying and teaching Isaiah, Alec Motyer presents a
               wealth of commentary and perspective on this book. His emphasis
               is on the grammatical, historical, structural, literary and
               theological dimensions of the text. Though based on the Hebrew
               text, his exposition easily accomodates readers without a
               working knowledge of biblical Hebrew. And he writes with an
               interest in Isaiah's meaning for Christians today. Along the
               historical timeline on which the Isaianic prophecies are strung,
               Motyer finds three central and recurring themes: the messianic
               hope, the motif of the city and the theology of the Holy One of
               Israel. Moreover, he argues, the Isaianic literature is
               organized around three messianic portraits: the King (Isaiah
               1-37), the Servant (Isaiah 38-55) and the Anointed Conqueror
               (Isaiah 56-66). Preachers, teachers and serious Bible students
               of all types will find this commentary a wise, winsome and
               welcome guide to the prophecy of Isaiah. It may easily be the
               best one-volume evangelical commentary on Isaiah available
               today.",

               contemporary readers who wish to use the sermon as the standard
               by which they live their lives every day. Matera shows how the
               Sermon on the Mount summons believers to single-minded devotion
               and wholehearted service to God. He unfolds the historical and
               theological background to the sermon. He explores the meaning of
               the individual Beatitudes, which articulate Jesus' call for a
               more abundant righteousness, piety without hypocrisy, and the
               need to become ``doers'' of the Word. This lively and engaging
               commentary is an ideal resource for adult education and Bible
               study groups. It is also ideal for all who want to live their
